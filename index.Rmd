## Project thoughts

I am interested in researching the US Supreme Court and analyzing whether certain factors (i.e. race, gender, law school affiliation, ethnicity, religion, etc.) affect how the justices voted on a particular body of cases (i.e. voting rights, mass incarceration, federalism, etc.). If possible, I would focus on a certain set of cases that belong to a certain category and try to understand which factors serve as useful proxies for how they would vote on a case. It would be interesting for a number of reasons because using a factor like race is interesting because only 5 justices have been racial minorities while only 6 women have been justices.
